Interactive Marker (IM) Server integrated with the Phantom Omni

This package provides a backend for the interaction_cursor_rviz package, allowing you to control the 3D cursor using the Phantom Omni. Download the omni_im_demo package as well, and simply:

roslaunch omni_im_demo omni_im_demo

Then add the InteractionCursor display to rviz.

Work is also in progress on a separate interaction tool to be used instead of interaction_cursor_rviz.
